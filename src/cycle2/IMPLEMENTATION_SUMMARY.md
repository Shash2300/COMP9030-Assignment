### 3. Frontend Data Integration

#### Issues Identified:
Currently, the following pages use mock data instead of backend:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**
   - Featured art grid (uses mock data)
   - Interactive map markers (uses mock data)
   - Solution: Already implemented via `api-wrapper.js` which overrides mock functions

2. **Browse Page (`browse.html`)**
   - Art listings (uses mock data)
   - Solution: Already implemented via `api-wrapper.js`

3. **Art Detail Page (`art-detail.html`)**
   - All fields populated from database
   - Missing: submission date and submitter username display
   - Solution: Update `api-wrapper.js` to include these fields

### 4. Backend API Files

#### Existing APIs:
- `login.php` - User authentication
- `register.php` - User registration
- `get-entries.php` - Fetch art entries
- `get-entry.php` - Fetch single entry
- `create-entry.php` - Create new submission
- `update-entry.php` - Update existing submission
- `delete-entry.php` - Delete submission
- `approve-entry.php` - Approve submission (admin)
- `reject-entry.php` - Reject submission (admin)

#### APIs Created:
- `report-content.php` - Handle content reports

#### APIs Needed:

- `get-users.php` - List all users (admin)
- `update-user-role.php` - Change user roles (admin)

### 5. Database Schema Requirements
