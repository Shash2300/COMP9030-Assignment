## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Testing:
1. ☐ Run database migrations for new tables (user_profiles, content_reports, activity_log)
2. ☐ Create remaining backend API files listed above
3. ☐ Verify database config in `cycle3/config/database.php`
4. ☐ Ensure admin users have `role='admin'` in users table
5. ☐ Test API endpoints with Postman/curl

### Testing Steps:
1. ☐ Register new user account
2. ☐ Submit art entry
3. ☐ View dashboard and check submission status
4. ☐ Edit a submission
5. ☐ Delete a submission
6. ☐ Update artist profile
7. ☐ Browse art gallery (verify database data shown)
8. ☐ Use search and filters
9. ☐ View art detail page
10. ☐ Report content on an entry
11. ☐ Login as admin
12. ☐ View admin dashboard statistics
13. ☐ Moderate submissions (approve/reject)
14. ☐ View content reports

## 💡 NOTES

1. **API Wrapper:** The existing `api-wrapper.js` already handles the conversion from database to frontend format, so homepage, browse, and art detail pages automatically use database data.

2. **Mock Data:** Mock data in `data/mock-data.js` is only used as a fallback if API calls fail.

3. **Authentication:** User authentication uses localStorage. For production, consider using secure HTTP-only cookies and sessions.

4. **Image Handling:** Currently using SVG placeholders. Actual image upload and storage needs to be implemented separately.

5. **Admin Authentication:** The admin login system is separate from user login. Admin accounts need to have `role='admin'` or `user_type='admin'` in the database.

6. **Missing JS Files:** User management and category management interfaces need their JavaScript implementation files created to be fully functional.
