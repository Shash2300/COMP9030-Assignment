### 2. JavaScript - Interactive Map (map.js)

**Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic)
**Date:** October 15, 2024

**Prompt:**
```
Create JavaScript for Leaflet map integration in the Indigenous Art Atlas. Requirements:
- Display art locations across Australia
- Different marker colors for ancient vs contemporary art
- Orange markers for culturally sensitive sites with approximate locations
- Clickable markers with popups showing art details
- Separate map for art detail page showing single location
- Interactive map for submission form where users can click to set coordinates
- Handle sensitive locations by adding random offset to protect exact coordinates
```

**AI Output:**
The AI generated map.js with:
- Leaflet map initialization centered on Australia
- Custom marker icons using divIcon for color customization
- Popup generation with art information and images
- Location obfuscation for sensitive sites (±5km random offset)

### 4. JavaScript - Form Validation (validation.js)

**Tool Used:** Claude (Anthropic)
**Date:** October 15, 2024

**Prompt:**
```
Create client-side form validation JavaScript for:
- Email format validation (RFC 5322 compliant)
- Password strength checking (min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers)
- Required field validation
- Coordinate validation (latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180 to 180)
- File upload validation (image types, max 5MB)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Matching password confirmation
- Accessibility with ARIA alerts for errors
```

**AI Output:**
The AI generated validation.js with:
- Regex patterns for email and password validation
- Real-time validation on blur/input events
- Visual error indicators with error messages
- Password strength calculator with weak/medium/strong levels
- Coordinate range validation for map submissions
- File type and size validation
- Form-wide validation function
- Accessibility features (role="alert" for errors)

**My Interpretation:**
Form validation is essential for data quality and user experience. The AI implemented both client-side convenience (immediate feedback) while understanding that server-side validation would be needed in Cycle 3. The password strength indicator helps users create secure accounts. The coordinate validation prevents submission errors. The accessibility features ensure screen reader users receive error notifications. I reviewed the validation logic and confirmed it matches the application requirements. The debouncing on input events prevents performance issues.
