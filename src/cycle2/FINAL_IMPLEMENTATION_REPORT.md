## 📝 ADDITIONAL NOTES

### **What Works Out of the Box:**
- All user-facing features
- Data integration (already using database)
- Search and filtering
- Report content system
- Edit/delete submissions
- Artist profiles

### **What Needs Database Setup:**
- Run `create_missing_tables.sql`
- Set admin users: `UPDATE users SET user_type = 'admin' WHERE ...`
- That's it!

### **API Configuration:**
All APIs use the path `../cycle3/api/` which assumes:
```
COMP9030-Assignment/
  src/
    cycle2/ (frontend)
    cycle3/
      api/ (backend)
      config/
        database.php
```

If your structure is different, update `API_BASE` in:
- `js/api.js`
- `js/api-wrapper.js`
